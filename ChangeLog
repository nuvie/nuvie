2004-02-16  Willem Jan Palenstijn <wjpalenstijn at users.sourceforge.net>
	* sound/*, Makefile.am: fixed build (include case, include dirs)
	* sound/SoundManager.cpp: show SDL_Mixer error when init fails
	* sound/SoundManager.cpp: changed buffer size to power of two

2004-02-16  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* More work on U6 music. Native songs no longer require the songs.cfg
	  file. Song changes aren't very smooth at the moment. I'll probably
	  add some fading when changing songs.

2004-02-12  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added a striped down version of AdPlug into nuvie.
	* Added an audio config section.
	* It is possible to play the original ultima6 .m adlib music tracks 
	  in Nuvie.
	  
	  Note! you will have to add entries into a song.cfg file in the 
	  sounddir directory. I'll add proper support for native song files
	  soon.
	  The song.cfg file should look somthing like this.

	  Castle;/fullpath_to_u6/BRIT.M;
	  Random;/fullpath_to_u6/ULTIMA.M;
	  Random;/fullpath_to_u6/FOREST.M;
	  Random;/fullpath_to_u6/BOOTUP.M;
	  Random;/fullpath_to_u6/STONES.M;
	  Dungeon;/fullpath_to_u6/DUNGEON.M;
	  Gargoyle;/fullpath_to_u6/GARGOYLE.M;
 
2004-02-07  Jonathan Wright <nelno at nelno.com>
    * Lots of little changes for VisualC7 and MSCV 6 build: 
      - added #pragma warning for forcing value to bool (got this a
        lot in .NET compiles, but it's only a minor performance warning from
        mixing bool and int)
      - Added new include directories for sound and fonts
      - changed some while (1) to for ( ; ; ) so that some "conditional 
        expression is constant warnings" go away in MS VC builds.
      - added assignment operator to ConfigNode to fix warning "assignment
        operator cound not be generated" in VC 6 and VC 7.
      - added roundf (float f) functions.  VC 6 and 7 don't define this in
        math.h (C99 standard only?)
      - fixed warning for potential use of uninitialized variable (pW) in 
        U6lzw.cpp (looked to me like this would be a problem with any properly
        formatted file, though).
    
2004-02-07  Willem Jan Palenstijn <wjpalenstijn at users.sourceforge.net>
	* sounds/*: fixed include case and added endlines at end of file
	* configure.ac: added check for SDL_mixer

2004-02-07  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Fixed the mysterious crash on multitile actors bug [ 890188 ].
	  Party members now dismount from horses before using ladders or caves.
	* Added keyboard commands to quit dialog. [ 874454 ] This was done by
	  adding a new class GUI_YesNoDialog. This still needs a little work.
	* Fixed a bug with ships. The Party would attempt to board the ship
	  even if you didn't have the correct deed.
	* You can now scroll back the MsgScroll buffer when in page break mode.
	  Not just at the input prompt.
	* Added Adrians sound support code. This has been commented out for the
	  time being. We need to add some config switches and support for
	  the original .m adlib music files.

2004-02-02  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* You can now move objects onto tables.
	* Fixed some compiler issues with STL on older versions of gcc.
	  Removed references to vector::at and string::clear
	* Fixed Avatar moving while dragging object bug. [ 888666 ]

2004-01-31  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Rewrote the MsgScroll Class.
	  - You can now scroll back through the MsgScroll when in input mode.
	    Using the up/down arrow keys.
	  - Clicking on a word while in input mode will add the word to your
	    input.
	  - You can now have multiple fonts per line.
	* Added new font/fontmanager classes to Nuvie. These classes should
	  be used instead of Text. This should help us in supporting MD and SE
	  fonts.
	* Fixed a few compiler warnings. Removed unused variables.
 	* Fixed InventoryWidget bug [ 881842 ] where every inventory slot
	  displayed the empty slot tile.
	* Fixed leak when viewing temp actor portraits.
	* Eggs now spawn on load / level change. 

2004-01-30  Joseph Applegate <sb-x at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added ability to MOVE actors (with the keyboard).
	* Fixed: obvious logical AND/OR error in ConverseInterpret (shortcut
	  left values on the opstack) that caused a freeze.
	  assertion in inventory (don't assume ready-items are in inventory)
	  These were in bugtracker item [ 886597 ].
	  NuvieIOBuffer (write/seek)
	* A few compile fixes for MSVC.
	* Upcoming mouse pointer stuff in but commented out.

2004-01-28  Joseph Applegate <sb-x at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Replaced the quantity loop for things hatched from eggs. My last egg
	"fix" removed that, but now that fix is fixed. You can get multiple
	actors of the same type from an egg again. (check animal pens, shrines)
	* UseCode: Remove IN_CONTAINER bit when dumping objects from containers.

2004-01-27  Joseph Applegate <sb-x at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added ability to READY and UNREADY objects with the keyboard
	  Press tab to move cursor to inventory, and return to ready/unready.
	  This is now hooked to Event::ready (which will move to PlayerActions)
	* Double-click to USE an object in the inventory works for readiable
	  objects (this introduces a slight delay in click-to-ready)
	* Actor: Various inventory management fixes. (in counting, adding, and
	  removing objects) This means Iolo's gather/split gold commands work
	  99% correct now. (it is taking gold from containers in Avatar's
	  inventory when it shouldn't, and I don't know how to determine the
	  maximum stack-quantity of objects)
	* Mice will pass/be passed by actors, and can go through mouseholes.

2004-01-24  Joseph Applegate <sb-x at users.sourceforge.net>
	* New alt-codes: 314-teleport to NPC,
	                 414-destination menu for lazy teleporters,
	                 456-morph npc appearance (forgot to mention last time)

2004-01-24  Joseph Applegate <sb-x at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Contents of eggs are now tossed out to a random location, if the egg
	  location is occupied by an actor. (the original U6 did some
	  interesting things with eggs; added a note to the TODO list)
	* ConverseInterpret: Either implemented or added placeholders for the
	  SLEEP, RESURRECT, INPUTSTR, DIV, and HASOBJ instructions. Thanks to
	  Paul Gilbert.
	* A walk delay is now imposed on continuous movement with the keyboard
	  or mouse. It can be set in Player::get_walk_delay().
	* Added Click & DoubleClick events to GUI_widget, along with the
	  necessary support functions. For now, a GUI_widget that defines
	  HandleEvent can't use these. All widgets' Idle() methods are called in
	  Event.
	* Removed Event::view_focus stuff. You now GUI::lock_input() on a
	  GUI_Widget that you wish to grab all events.
	* Mouse movement and actions on the MapWindow are more solid now. There
	  is still some minor work to complete on it.
	* Event: Much of the code in the handleKeyDown switch moved to new
	  public methods. (doAction/cancelAction/newAction) I took the new
	  doLook/doUse methods and replaced them with multiple use/look
	  incarnations. The messages printed should be accurate now. Each one
	  returns to the prompt when it is finished.
	* Solo/party mode switching implemented. The other party members will
	  oddly get stuck until you move the leader in Solo mode.
	* In preparation of the new MsgScroll that will hopefully be able to
	  convert to multiple fonts on any line, I've changed alt-code 214 to
	  be more like the original. (and use identical <>-escaped prompts) It
	  doesn't work aboard ship anymore.
	* Misc. fixes

2004-01-21  Willem Jan Palenstijn <wjpalenstijn at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Makefile.mingw, */Makefile.common: added new tools to Makefile.mingw

2004-01-20  Joseph Applegate <sb-x at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Alt-214 codes can be entered with the numeric keypad now.
	* Keys F1-F10 enabled to switch between party members and roster.
	* Fixed Sundials (allowing potentially other timed animations in
	  TileManager.
	* Added testing usecode for Eggs, and a new LOAD event. (unused)
	* Changed the way game-timers work, now having two queues in Event,
	  and using new game_ticks counter in GameClock. Game ticks are updating
	  with the game time, unlike moves.
	* Fun with GUI_Widget... (this is barely tested and will be cleaned up)
	  Left-click MsgScroll during conversation to keep scrolling,
	  Right-click to say bye (or say whatever is typed).
	  Double-click InventoryWidget to use an item.
	  Hold left mouse button in MapWindow to walk towards cursor.
	  Double-click left button MapWindow to use an object (not working
	  correctly yet) or talk to an actor.
	  Left-click in MapWindow to select an object or actor for the current
	  action (use, look, talk, get).
	* ADEMAS! (more fun with GUI_Widget)
	  Merged inventory-look/use changes from Adrian Boeing:
	  Left-click in InventoryWidget or DollWidget to select an object to
	  look at or use. (after entering the appropriate mode)
	  Divided Event::look() and use() into smaller, more modular functions.
	  (everything needs more testing)

2004-01-20  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Moved egg spawning code into its own method 
	  spawn_egg(Obj *egg, uint8 hatch_probability);
	* Changed the container logic again. It turns out that x is always used
	  to find the container. But if the objblk_n > 1024 then you must add
	  1024 to x to find the correct container. So if y & 0x1 then add 1024
	  to x.

2004-01-18  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added correct dithering tile offsets for SE.
	* Removed some DOS crlf's that slipped into the source tree.

2004-01-17  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Sam added dithered darkness. But forgot to write it up in the
	  ChangeLog. ;-)

2004-01-16  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Objects now spawn from eggs.
	* Actors can walk over or under other actors again. :) Might need to fix
	  actor ordering.

2004-01-16  Joseph Applegate <sb-x at users.sourceforge.net>
	* You can MOVE objects around with the keyboard now, and special usecode
	  may be called. You can't move actors yet.
	* UseCode events TIMED and MOVE added. New objects Powder Keg & Cannon.
	* New alt-code 300: show NPC portrait (this will be changed to "show
	  portrait number")
	* Portraits now only display until the player presses a key to continue.
	  Event has to switch focus to it and PortraitView has to set `waiting'
	  to "true".
	* Portrait: Fixed the incorrect portrait number references. Actor 0
	  displays no portrait (at least as a vehicle), shrines display no
	  portraits, and Exodus' portrait number was off by 3. You can see
	  gargoyles' portraits when you look at them now.
	* Converse: Hardcoded script numbers added from actors 188+,
	  including temporary NPCs. You can talk to Guards and Wisps now, and
	  the shrines use the correct conversations.
	* NPCs 188 to 200 are considered "always known" and their name is
	  displayed when you talk to them.
	* View focus added to EVENT. This lets us do things like display a
	  portrait temporarily, or browse inventory with the keyboard.
	  Unfortunately with the current event system it means more work has to
	  be done when you want to get user input (you have to switch the
	  focus). This should be managed by ViewManger in the future.
	* Event: A couple of functions added to make getting input and showing
	  portraits while switching focus to the appropriate view easier.
	* TimeQueue now operates in Real Time (milliseconds) and Game Time
	  (ticks/turns).
	* New timer TimedCallback added. It is a flexible method of setting a
	  callback function on any class to be called with the time is up, and
	  with user-defined data. The class has to inherit TimedCallbackTarget.
	* Use GameTimedCallback to do this in game ticks/turns.
	* GameClock: Time counter added. This counts the number of minutes
	  since start. Return this with get_time().
	* Other new methods to GameClock: get_turn() returns move_counter
	                                  get_ticks() returns SDL_Ticks()

2004-01-14  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added the original hacked object creation. You can now use spam to
	  make hacked objects in Nuvie. These objects have an overflowed
	  frame_n. This makes them look like one object but behave like another.
	* A small MsgScroll rendering fix. The page break arrow now displays
	  on the last line of text not on a new line.
	* Added Sam Matthews and Jonathan E. Wright to the AUTHORS file.

2004-01-13  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added use:beehive.
	* More work on eggs. There are two status flags that effect eggs.
	  I'm still not sure what these flags do exactly. So their names
	  in the source may change in the future.
	* Changed round() to roundf() as we were dealing with floats anyway.
	* Added a new alt-code. Alt-216 display current time. :-)

2004-01-12  Joseph Applegate <sb-x at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Tools: unpack_conv working again. (broken files were being produced
	  and repack -r didn't work because of U6Lib_n differences)

2004-01-11  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Fixed a crash on load bug. [ 874477 ] Nuvie would crash while loading
	  if the game was saved at night or in a dungeon. Nuvie was trying to
	  render the darkness globes before they had been initialized.

2004-01-10  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added use:churn. Using a churn now makes butter. If you have a bucket
	  of milk in your inventory.
	* Fixed MsgScroll rendering. Some words were wrapped to the next line
	  when they could have fit. Text placement should be closer to the
	  original now. I've still got some work to do in MsgScroll.

2004-01-08  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added Sam's optimized darkness patch. The Darkness code should be a
	  lot faster now.
	* Some work on weapon stats. I'm not completely sure how combat will
	  end up. But at least the combat numbers are written down someware. ;)

2004-01-02  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added rolling pin to the list of readiable objects.

2003-12-31  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added twitching to the hydra tenticles.
	* Nuvie will no longer show a blank portrait when looking at a
	  temp actor with no portrait.
	* Guards and wisps now show a portrait when you look at them.

2003-12-29  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* MapWindow: Added permenant darkness to dungeon levels.
	* ObjManager: Added is_stackable method for checking if an object can
	  be pluralised.
	* Event: Fixed the "Look" event. It now says "They weigh" when looking
	  at an item with a quantity > 1.
	* U6Actor: Added dragon actors. I've also started Hydra support.
 
2003-12-25  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Some fixes for object weight. Inventory weight should be closer to the
	  original now.
	
2003-12-25  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Fixed an issue with containers. [ 864087 ] There are some comtainer
	  objects that don't reference their container through the x variable.
	  They seem to follow the container object in the objblk files. They
	  also appear to have a positive > 0 value for y.
	  I think their might still be some issues with calculating inventory 
	  weight.

2003-12-21  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Fixed inventory display order. Nuvie was displaying the inventory 
	  list in reverse order. Thanks to Dominus for spotting that one.

2003-12-20  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Work on horse usecode. Temporary Actors are used correctly when
	  mounting/dismounting horses.
	* The player can no longer use character horses eg Iolo's horse.
 
2003-12-14  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Fixed walk on pedastal bug. [ 791146 ]
	* Fixed lockup when walking to the top or left of the map. This only
	  really occured in the dungeon levels.

2003-12-13  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* A fix for an infinite loop when removing temporary eggs.

2003-12-10  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added proper worktype for cows and horses. They keep within the fenced
	  areas now.
	* Some minor tweeks for multi-tile actors. 
	* Note! I've got a crash when I create two multi-tile
	  actors on the same spot. eg over an egg. I haven't tracked down
	  what's causing this crash yet. :(

2003-12-08  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added egg support. Eggs now spawn Actors as you pass them by. :)
	  I've still got a bit to do on this. Eggs need to throw their contents
	  around the map. At the moment Actors are all spawning on top of their
	  egg. This is causing some problems for multi-tile actors. I'll fix 
	  this soon. I've also got to handle the creation of non Actor objects.
	  This includes Reagents.
	* Added temp actor mangagement. Added the ability to create temp actors.
	* Added Use Cow. Using a cow will fill an empty bucket in the player's
	  inventory with milk.
	* Added Use Well. This will fill a bucket with water.
	* Added Apple XCode build configuration.

2003-12-04  Joseph Applegate <sb-x at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Fixed closed containers dumping contents.
	* Temp. fix added for horses disappearing after riding.
	* People riding horses dismount now before boarding a ship.

2003-12-03  Joseph Applegate <sb-x at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Starting from an in-vehicle savegame works correctly now.
	* Player: The party only follows if you are controlling the leader now,
	  but is moved if you are controlling a vehicle.
	  Player tells ActorManager the new player actor when set.
	* The player actor at start is found by looking at actor worktypes.
	* Renamed Actor::inventory_add_object(Obj*) to inventory_new_object(),
	  and it now returns an object pointer.
	* New object weight tests: can_carry_object(), can_carry_weight()
	* UseCode: Added some new searchables, and code for fountains (not fully
	  implemented) and shovels. Fixed bug in food code that could prevent
	  food/drinks from being removed properly when eaten.

2003-12-03  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Fixed double free when cleaning up temp objects.
	* Update darkness when creating a moongate.
	* Fixed crash when exiting ships.
	* Added in_vehicle to Party.

2003-12-03  Joseph Applegate <sb-x at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Objects are removed from temp. list when removed from the map.
	* Fixed segfault when getting objects and stacking them in inventory.

2003-12-02  Joseph Applegate <sb-x at users.sourceforge.net>
	* You can no longer walk diagonally between blocked squares. This fixes
	  walking over water.
	* Updated Horse code (can't use another horse while riding), and added
	  Codex of Ultimate Wisdom to book list.
	* Mirrors now showing reflection when NPC's pass by them. [ 716226 ]

2003-12-01  Joseph Applegate <sb-x at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Minor improvements made to how the party follows, in Party, PathFinder
	  and ZPath. They are a little more jumpy now, but that will be fixed in
	  the future. PathFinder path isn't cleared unless dest changes.
	* Timeouts added when you enter a dungon or vehicle, use a ladder, or
	  walk to a vehicle. If the party isn't at the target within a limited
	  number of moves, they will be moved there. Original U6 did this too.
	* Fixed infinite loop bug in money exchange with Teri at the mint.
	  (and potentially other NPCs) [ 841963 ]
	* New configuration options: party_all_the_time allows you to add/remove
	  anyone in the world to/from your party if you can talk to them (for
	  test purposes only of course ;)) and enable_hackmove lets any object
	  get moved with the mouse.
	* Karma is now reduced when taking objects owned by someone else (but
	  some objects don't have their OK_TO_TAKE flag set when they should).
	* Unusable actors aren't used. An object at the same location is always
	  used first.
	* New method in MapWindow to check if "in_dungeon_level()".
	* Party: Besides changes to following, new is_leader() method checks to
	  see if an actor is the party leader. Actor::set_in_party() is called
	  for maintenance when actors join/leave.
	* Actor U6Actor: Move counter added to help pathfinders, so
	  that actors may only walk a limited number of spaces per turn. This is
	  really touchy, so any future code changes that affect actor movement
	  should be done carefully. Forced moves won't check/alter the counter,
	  and vehicles have no move limit.
	* Fixed a glitch in set_direction(uint8) that wasn't updating direction
	  at all in some cases. But the actors now appear to loop walking frames
	  incorrectly. (don't know if this is a new issue)
	* Worktype location added to keep actors within a small area around
	  their schedule destination. *Actor::set_worktype() updates location.*
	  The activities Beg and Wander are now limited to a small area.
	* Player: Had to add a workaround for above movecounter limitation, so
	  that player can always move.
	* Karma add/subtract functions given default values.
	* TimedPartyMove TimedPartMoveToVehicle: Fix for walking to moongates
	  now uses new Actor::is_nearby() test.
	* ActorManager: Don't do scheduled activities if in the party.
	* UseCode: Holy flames can't be doused.
	  Object numbers of fire,poison,sleep,protection fields added.

2003-11-28  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added proper check when using orb of moons. You can only use the
	  orb after saying 'orb' to Lord British.
	* Moved hour change check from Actor to ActorManager. ActorManager
	  only calls Actor::updateSchedule() when the hour changes.

2003-11-26  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Light globes are now not drawn for blacked out objects.
	
2003-11-25  Jonathan E. Wright <nelno at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Fixed VS .NET build to work with alpha blended darkness.
	* Fixed MSVC 6 build to work with alpha blended darkness.
	* Just found this file and realized what Eric meant by "update the 
	  change log"... I thought you meant the change log in CVS.  Sorry. :)
	  
2003-11-25  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added Sam Matthew's Alpha blended darkness. :-) This is still a 
	  little rough around the edges but it is looking really nice!
	* Fixed the palette rotation. It was rotating the wrong way.

2003-11-24  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added Pieter Luteijn's Use orb code.
	* A small OS X compile fix. Added #ifdef check for _MSC_VER in 
	  nuvieDefs.h

2003-11-23  Jonathan E. Wright <nelno at users.sourceforge.net>
    * Added Visual Studio .NET 2003 build configuration.

2003-11-20  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Fixed avatar portrait. It was out by 1. Thanks to Pieter Luteijn for
	  spotting that one. [ 845094 ]

2003-11-18  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* More code cleaning.

2003-11-17  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Renamed U6def.h to nuvieDefs.h and moved it to the root dir.
	* Fixed Actor blocking. You can now move over and under certain actors.
	  Eg. you can walk over mice and under birds, dragons etc.

2003-11-16  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Header #include cleanup.

2003-11-15  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Fixed crash when entering caves on the gargoyle plane.
	* Added usecode for entering the red moongates.
	  It isn't currently possible to create moongates. As we need to 
	  overhaul the Event system.
	  We also need to fix TimedPartyMove::timed so we can use the moongate
	  to travel to a destination on the same plane. At the moment you
	  can only travel to destinations on a different plane to the
	  moongate. :(
	* Added blocking checks for Use-passthrough
	* Changed "blocked!" message to "Not now!".
	* Added diagonal movement via the keypad.

2003-11-14  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added day of week to GameClock
	* Added day of week to schedules.
	* Fixed the number of days in a month. Britannia has 28 day months.
	* Clean the screen after an unsuccessful drop.
	* Don't close doors if blocked. [ 841973 ]

2003-11-14  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	Merged Jonathan E. Wright's changes.
	They are...
	* Added Dragging from MapWindow to other GUI objects.
	* Added movement by the keypad.
	* Added Map::lineTest this method checks a line of sight from the
	  player to a point on the map for passability.
	* Made drag inventory->world, paperdoll->world, world->world,
	  world->paperdoll and world->inventory use lineTest to ensure the

2003-10-30  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>

2003-10-29  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Moved temp obj addition into ObjManager::add_obj()
	* Added ObjManager::delete_obj() method to delete an object and any
	  container items it might hold.
	* Don't display actors with a 0 object number.

2003-10-27  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Started work on temp obj removal. This still needs work. It may
	  be quite unstable.
	* Added the ability to hide eggs via a config switch.

2003-10-19  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Changed ObjManager::is_passable return codes OBJ_STATUS_ to OBJ_ and
	  added proper OBJ_STATUS_ defines for Obj status bit flags.

2003-10-18  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added a small tool for unpacking U6 FM-Towns audio files.
	  The tool extracts all samples in a given file as 16bit wav files.

	* Fixed player sitting bug.

2003-10-14  Joseph Applegate <sb-x at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Party members will now walk up and enter skiffs and ships when using.
	* Blacksmith NPC's can sell you a horse. There is a serious bug here
	  that I haven't reproduced yet.
	* Certain objects should have proper tile animations now
	  (crank/chain/bell), so this fixes the relevant bug item. [ 713532 ]
	* Bells (like the one in Britain) can be used too, but still no sound.
	* TimedEvent: Timer functions moved from Event to new files
	* ObjManager TileManager: Tile animation control methods added here

2003-10-12  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>

	  I'll fix this when we add the temp actor management methods into
	  ActorManager.

2003-10-07  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added split-type actors. Cows, horses, etc.
	* Added twitch support for some multi-tile actors.
	* Some worktype tweaks.
	* Actor: changed old_obj_n to base_obj_n.

2003-10-07  Joseph Applegate <sb-x at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Objects can be used on other objects now (use-chaining). Right now
	  this works for keys (but only on doors), and potions (but only to
	  print a message).
	* Timers can start immediately, so entering dungeons and using ladders
	  starts as soon as the object is used. You can also exit dungeons now.
	* Searching of spaces adjacent to the player is possible now. You can
	  do this for secret doors, bags, and some other things. Other normal
	  containers must be "used".
	* Container contents are now printed in the message scroller when they
	  are removed from the container.
	* Looking at actors shouldn't display a weight if they are on an object.
	* Actor/MapWindow: couple of new methods here to return MapCoords

2003-10-06  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* More work on multi-tile actors.
	* Added different movetypes for actors.

	  but it's a start. :)

2003-10-05  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Moved Actor walk info into a table. Most Actor types should move 
	  around correctly now. This should fix the Sherry bug. [ 716209 ]
	* Added some object printing routines.

2003-09-16  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Quantities are only displayed for stackable items in InventoryWidget.
          Note I have still got to implement U6 key display eg 'A', 'B' etc.

          quit dialog.

2003-09-14  Joseph Applegate <sb-x at users.sourceforge.net>

	NPC number.

2003-09-14  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Reworked MsgScroll to handle lines in other fonts. I'm not completely
          satisfied with this. As you can only have one font per line. :(
	* You can now select an actor to talk to with either the 't' key or
          the 'Enter' key.
	* Signs should display in runic as required. [ 805253 ]
	* Fixed Look quantity bug. [ 742559 ]

2003-09-13  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Fixed wall reshaping bug with cookfires.
	* Partial fix for runic signs. This will not work with multi-line 
          message strings. I'll fix that soon.

2003-09-11  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Finally Fixed the wall corner tile display bug. [ 713521 ] :)
	* Some code comments added.

2003-09-11  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added arrows to InventoryWidget.

2003-09-10  Joseph Applegate <sb-x at users.sourceforge.net>
	* TimeQueue and Timers added to Event files. These should probably be
	moved into their own file(s).
	* Actor and Player respect "uncontrolled" flag on Player, preventing
	move of Player or MapWindow recentering.
	* The entire party properly walks towards ladders when used, or
	caves when entered, and reappears on the other side. You cannot exit
	dungeons yet.

2003-09-09  Eric Fry <efry at users.sourceforge.net>
	* Replaced gcc-3.3 with gcc in the Project Builder build system.
	* Added quantity strings to InventoryWidget

	* Changed/added to Actor::set_direction()/face_location().
	* Actor walking can be given a delay (don't start for that many turns)

	* Actor, PathFinder: Path-finding/direction finding classes added and
	accessible from Actor. The path-finder is incomplete and distant
	destinations aren't reachable yet. There are still a few glitches.
	* Added some direction definitions that are at least easier to remember
	than 0, 1, 2, 3.
	* Game: Made map_window, obj_manager, and usecode made static so they

2003-07-11  Joseph Applegate <sb-x at users.sourceforge.net>
