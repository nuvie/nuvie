2003-12-02  Joseph Applegate <sb-x@users.sourceforge.net>
	* You can no longer walk diagonally between blocked squares. This fixes
	  walking over water.
	* Updated Horse code (can't use another horse while riding), and added
	  Codex of Ultimate Wisdom to book list.
	* Mirrors now showing reflection when NPC's pass by them. [ 716226 ]

2003-12-01  Joseph Applegate <sb-x@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Minor improvements made to how the party follows, in Party, PathFinder
	  and ZPath. They are a little more jumpy now, but that will be fixed in
	  the future. PathFinder path isn't cleared unless dest changes.
	* Timeouts added when you enter a dungon or vehicle, use a ladder, or
	  walk to a vehicle. If the party isn't at the target within a limited
	  number of moves, they will be moved there. Original U6 did this too.
	* Fixed infinite loop bug in money exchange with Teri at the mint.
	  (and potentially other NPCs) [ 841963 ]
	* New configuration options: party_all_the_time allows you to add/remove
	  anyone in the world to/from your party if you can talk to them (for
	  test purposes only of course ;)) and enable_hackmove lets any object
	  get moved with the mouse.
	* Karma is now reduced when taking objects owned by someone else (but
	  some objects don't have their OK_TO_TAKE flag set when they should).
	* Unusable actors aren't used. An object at the same location is always
	  used first.
	* New method in MapWindow to check if "in_dungeon_level()".
	* Party: Besides changes to following, new is_leader() method checks to
	  see if an actor is the party leader. Actor::set_in_party() is called
	  for maintenance when actors join/leave.
	* Actor U6Actor: Move counter added to help pathfinders, so
	  that actors may only walk a limited number of spaces per turn. This is
	  really touchy, so any future code changes that affect actor movement
	  should be done carefully. Forced moves won't check/alter the counter,
	  and vehicles have no move limit.
	* Fixed a glitch in set_direction(uint8) that wasn't updating direction
	  at all in some cases. But the actors now appear to loop walking frames
	  incorrectly. (don't know if this is a new issue)
	* Worktype location added to keep actors within a small area around
	  their schedule destination. *Actor::set_worktype() updates location.*
	  The activities Beg and Wander are now limited to a small area.
	* Player: Had to add a workaround for above movecounter limitation, so
	  that player can always move.
	* Karma add/subtract functions given default values.
	* TimedPartyMove TimedPartMoveToVehicle: Fix for walking to moongates
	  now uses new Actor::is_nearby() test.
	* ActorManager: Don't do scheduled activities if in the party.
	* UseCode: Holy flames can't be doused.
	  Object numbers of fire,poison,sleep,protection fields added.

2003-11-28  Eric Fry <efry@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added proper check when using orb of moons. You can only use the
	  orb after saying 'orb' to Lord British.
	* Moved hour change check from Actor to ActorManager. ActorManager
	  only calls Actor::updateSchedule() when the hour changes.

2003-11-26  Eric Fry <efry@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Light globes are now not drawn for blacked out objects.
	
2003-11-25  Jonathan E. Wright <nelno@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Fixed VS .NET build to work with alpha blended darkness.
	* Fixed MSVC 6 build to work with alpha blended darkness.
	* Just found this file and realized what Eric meant by "update the 
	  change log"... I thought you meant the change log in CVS.  Sorry. :)
	  
2003-11-25  Eric Fry <efry@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added Sam Matthew's Alpha blended darkness. :-) This is still a 
	  little rough around the edges but it is looking really nice!
	* Fixed the palette rotation. It was rotating the wrong way.

2003-11-24  Eric Fry <efry@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added Pieter Luteijn's Use orb code.
	* A small OS X compile fix. Added #ifdef check for _MSC_VER in 
	  nuvieDefs.h

2003-11-23  Jonathan E. Wright <nelno@users.sourceforge.net>
    * Added Visual Studio .NET 2003 build configuration.

2003-11-20  Eric Fry <efry@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Fixed avatar portrait. It was out by 1. Thanks to Pieter Luteijn for
	  spotting that one. [ 845094 ]

2003-11-18  Eric Fry <efry@users.sourceforge.net>
	* More code cleaning.

2003-11-17  Eric Fry <efry@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Renamed U6def.h to nuvieDefs.h and moved it to the root dir.
	* Fixed Actor blocking. You can now move over and under certain actors.
	  Eg. you can walk over mice and under birds, dragons etc.

2003-11-16  Eric Fry <efry@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Header #include cleanup.

2003-11-15  Eric Fry <efry@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Fixed crash when entering caves on the gargoyle plane.
	* Added usecode for entering the red moongates.
	  It isn't currently possible to create moongates. As we need to 
	  overhaul the Event system.
	  We also need to fix TimedPartyMove::timed so we can use the moongate
	  to travel to a destination on the same plane. At the moment you
	  can only travel to destinations on a different plane to the
	  moongate. :(
	* Added blocking checks for Use-passthrough
	* Changed "blocked!" message to "Not now!".
	* Added diagonal movement via the keypad.

2003-11-14  Eric Fry <efry@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added day of week to GameClock
	* Added day of week to schedules.
	* Fixed the number of days in a month. Britannia has 28 day months.
	* Clean the screen after an unsuccessful drop.
	* Don't close doors if blocked. [ 841973 ]

2003-11-14  Eric Fry <efry@users.sourceforge.net>
	Merged Jonathan E. Wright's changes.
	They are...
	* Added Dragging from MapWindow to other GUI objects.
	* Added movement by the keypad.
	* Added Map::lineTest this method checks a line of sight from the
	  player to a point on the map for passability.
	* Made drag inventory->world, paperdoll->world, world->world,
	  world->paperdoll and world->inventory use lineTest to ensure the
	  player can reach the item and the spot where it is being dropped.
	* Show objects being dragged / dropped under cursor.

2003-10-30  Eric Fry <efry@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Temporary objects now clear on level change, teleport.

2003-10-29  Eric Fry <efry@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Moved temp obj addition into ObjManager::add_obj()
	* Added ObjManager::delete_obj() method to delete an object and any
	  container items it might hold.
	* Don't display actors with a 0 object number.

2003-10-27  Eric Fry <efry@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Started work on temp obj removal. This still needs work. It may
	  be quite unstable.
	* Added the ability to hide eggs via a config switch.

2003-10-19  Eric Fry <efry@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Changed ObjManager::is_passable return codes OBJ_STATUS_ to OBJ_ and
	  added proper OBJ_STATUS_ defines for Obj status bit flags.

2003-10-18  Eric Fry <efry@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added a small tool for unpacking U6 FM-Towns audio files.
	  The tool extracts all samples in a given file as 16bit wav files.

2003-10-16  Eric Fry <efry@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Fixed rendering error with ships.
	* Fixed player sitting bug.

2003-10-14  Joseph Applegate <sb-x@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Party members will now walk up and enter skiffs and ships when using.
	* Blacksmith NPC's can sell you a horse. There is a serious bug here
	  that I haven't reproduced yet.
	* Certain objects should have proper tile animations now
	  (crank/chain/bell), so this fixes the relevant bug item. [ 713532 ]
	* Bells (like the one in Britain) can be used too, but still no sound.
	* TimedEvent: Timer functions moved from Event to new files
	* ObjManager TileManager: Tile animation control methods added here

2003-10-12  Eric Fry <efry@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added "use" support for skiffs, ships and horses.
          Ship support is still a bit rough. Horse's disappear after use. :(
	  I'll fix this when we add the temp actor management methods into
	  ActorManager.

2003-10-07  Eric Fry <efry@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added split-type actors. Cows, horses, etc.
	* Added twitch support for some multi-tile actors.
	* Some worktype tweaks.
	* Actor: changed old_obj_n to base_obj_n.

2003-10-07  Joseph Applegate <sb-x@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Objects can be used on other objects now (use-chaining). Right now
	  this works for keys (but only on doors), and potions (but only to
	  print a message).
	* Timers can start immediately, so entering dungeons and using ladders
	  starts as soon as the object is used. You can also exit dungeons now.
	* Searching of spaces adjacent to the player is possible now. You can
	  do this for secret doors, bags, and some other things. Other normal
	  containers must be "used".
	* Container contents are now printed in the message scroller when they
	  are removed from the container.
	* Looking at actors shouldn't display a weight if they are on an object.
	* Actor/MapWindow: couple of new methods here to return MapCoords

2003-10-06  Eric Fry <efry@users.sourceforge.net>
	* More work on multi-tile actors.
	* Added different movetypes for actors.
	* Added support for ships and skiffs. They can't be used yet 
	  but it's a start. :)

2003-10-05  Eric Fry <efry@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Moved Actor walk info into a table. Most Actor types should move 
	  around correctly now. This should fix the Sherry bug. [ 716209 ]
	* Added some object printing routines.

2003-09-16  Eric Fry <efry@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Quantities are only displayed for stackable items in InventoryWidget.
          Note I have still got to implement U6 key display eg 'A', 'B' etc.
	* Pressing the window manager's [X] button now brings up the 
          quit dialog.

2003-09-14  Joseph Applegate <sb-x@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Fixed segfault when quitting during a conversation. (thanks wjp!)
	[ 765881 ]
	* Fixed HEAL bug that would prevent healer NPCs from getting the injured
	NPC number.

2003-09-14  Eric Fry <efry@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Reworked MsgScroll to handle lines in other fonts. I'm not completely
          satisfied with this. As you can only have one font per line. :(
	* You can now select an actor to talk to with either the 't' key or
          the 'Enter' key.
	* Signs should display in runic as required. [ 805253 ]
	* Fixed Look quantity bug. [ 742559 ]
	* Alt 214 now displays in "Location" Gargoylian. :)

2003-09-13  Eric Fry <efry@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Fixed wall reshaping bug with cookfires.
	* Partial fix for runic signs. This will not work with multi-line 
          message strings. I'll fix that soon.

2003-09-11  Eric Fry <efry@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Finally Fixed the wall corner tile display bug. [ 713521 ] :)
	* Some code comments added.

2003-09-11  Eric Fry <efry@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added arrows to InventoryWidget.

2003-09-10  Joseph Applegate <sb-x@users.sourceforge.net>
	* TimeQueue and Timers added to Event files. These should probably be
	moved into their own file(s).
	* Actor and Player respect "uncontrolled" flag on Player, preventing
	move of Player or MapWindow recentering.
	* The entire party properly walks towards ladders when used, or
	caves when entered, and reappears on the other side. You cannot exit
	dungeons yet.

2003-09-09  Eric Fry <efry@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Replaced gcc-3.3 with gcc in the Project Builder build system.
	* Added quantity strings to InventoryWidget
	* Event::Get Fixed weight check bug. Weight was aleady
	  multiplied by obj->qty

2003-09-07  Eric Fry <efry@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Fix for stackable items in Event::Get

2003-09-07  Eric Fry <efry@users.sourceforge.net>
	* MapWindow: You can now drop objects into containers on the map.

	  Actor instead of being copied.
	* Added some more items to the TODO file.

2003-09-06  Eric Fry <efry@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Some win32 compile fixes (Thanks vividos)

	* It is now possible to ready/unready items by clicking or dragging.

2003-09-04  Eric Fry <efry@users.sourceforge.net>

	  Brad Oliver for spotting that one. :)

2003-07-29  Joseph Applegate <sb-x@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Changed/added to Actor::set_direction()/face_location().
	* Actor walking can be given a delay (don't start for that many turns)
	* Long range path-finder improved. Short range still needs work.
	* Made game static/global. A Game instance can be retrieved from itself.
	* New distance methods of MapCoord, to check each direction.
	* Player: party movement and mapwindow re-centering is now in Actor
	* Event: any NPC can be followed/watched with alt-code 500.

2003-07-26  Joseph Applegate <sb-x@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Actor, PathFinder: Path-finding/direction finding classes added and
	accessible from Actor. The path-finder is incomplete and distant
	destinations aren't reachable yet. There are still a few glitches.
	* Added some direction definitions that are at least easier to remember
	than 0, 1, 2, 3.
	* Game: Made map_window, obj_manager, and usecode made static so they
	can be easily accessed. The Game object itself should probably be static
	instead.
	* Map: Added get_actor() to get an actor at a location on the map.
	* New Type/Class MapCoord for easier passing of map/tile coordinates.
	MapWindow:in_window() checks to see if a map coordinate is on screen.

	When moving, other actors except party members block the player.
	* UseCode: is_unlocked_door() checks if object is door that can be opened.
	* Added classes: PathFinder AStar LPath ZPath

2003-07-18  Joseph Applegate <sb-x@users.sourceforge.net>

2003-07-16  Joseph Applegate <sb-x@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Random strings said by Beh Lem and other NPC's (try patients in Cove)
	are printed correctly now, instead of resulting in "Unknown command."

2003-07-15  Eric Fry <efry@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Some small compile fixes.
	* Added Use Vortex. ;) Just for fun.

2003-07-15  Joseph Applegate <sb-x@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added [Avatar] HP global var. for conversations, changed init. of
	PARTY* vars to number of followers, and increased number of vars to 36.
	* >=, <= operators fixed (tested with original U6 engine) This and above
	removes the extra Avatar in party listings (such as in shops.)
	*U6OP_RAND should no longer return values outside the given range,
	resolves issue of Lord British repeating things. (tracker item 755717)

2003-07-11  Joseph Applegate <sb-x@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Conversation interpreter is correctly skipping "buffer size" at start
	of non-Lzw-encoded scripts now. Should've been done already but maybe I
	rewrote that part and overlooked it.

2003-07-06  Joseph Applegate <sb-x@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Handle both upper and lower case y/n input (tracker item 765879)

2003-07-06  Eric Fry <efry@users.sourceforge.net>

	  lower tile flag when rendering.

2003-07-05  Eric Fry <efry@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Fixed typo in Project Builder project name. Most source files were 
	  titled "Nuive" instead of "Nuvie". Thanks to Pieter Luteijn for
	  spotting that one. ;)
	* Nuvie now uses new NuvieIOFile classes for file access.

2003-07-04  Eric Fry <efry@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added files for new IO classes. NuvieIO.cpp/h

2003-06-27  Eric Fry <efry@users.sourceforge.net>

	New ops handled: ADDKARMA, SUBKARMA, and NPC stats.

2003-06-14  Eric Fry <efry@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Work started on MD and SE support. Both games now load in a limited
	  capacity if a copy of U6 is present.

2003-06-08  Joseph Applegate <sb-x@users.sourceforge.net>
	* NPCs who should be working no longer tell you they are out-to-lunch.

        * Scale: Grapped Scale2x scaler from Exult CVS

2003-05-27  Eric Fry <efry@users.sourceforge.net>

	  speed things up a bit on slower machines.

2003-05-25  Joseph Applegate <sb-x@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Actor/ObjManager: Update to inventory and statistic access methods.
	(adding/deleting items works, and set_hp(), get_maxhp() added)
