Notes on getting Nuvie to build in Visual Studio 2017
-----------------------------------------------------

These instructions are specific to Visual Studio 2017. I'm using the Community
version, but any version will do.

Libraries
---------

Nuvie uses the Simple Direct Media Layer (SDL) libraries, but you no longer
have to download and install them. SDL is included as a NuGet package, and it
will automatically download from https://nuget.org/ if you don't already have
it.


Executing from Visual Studio
----------------------------

Open up Visual Studio 2017 and open the .sln file in this folder. Set the
configuration to "Debug" or "Release". In the project settings, choose
"Debugging" in the left pane. It should already say "$(TargetPath)" in the
right hand pane in the Command field. In the "Working Directory" field, add
"$(TargetDir)" (without the quotes, of course).

Create a nuvie.cfg (using the sample config from Git) and place this in your
Debug and Release directories (this tells Nuvie where to find Ultima 6, so it
is very important). You also need the "data" folder, just copy it to the
Debug and Release folders, too.

Use "Build > Build Solution" to build the project. You can also use
"Debug > Start Debugging" or use the green arrow to build and debug Nuvie.


SDL debug version
-----------------

You can also use the debug version of SDL, in order to troubleshoot problems.
For this to work, you have to build SDL2 from source in debug configuration.
How to do this is outside of the scope of this document.

Then open the NuGet package manager for the nuvie project and remove the
sdl2 and sdl2.redist packages. In the project settings, choose "C/C++ > General"
and add the include folder for SDL2. In "Linker > Input" add the SDL2.lib
and SDL2main.lib, and place the SDL2.dll in the nuvie output folder.
