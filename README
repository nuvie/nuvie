Nuvie - An Engine for Ultima6, Martian Dreams and Savage Empire.
http://nuvie.sourceforge.net/

Version 0.5 


What is Nuvie
-------------

Nuvie (Pronounced New-Vee) is an open source engine for Origin's games
Ultima 6, Martian Dreams and The Savage Empire. It uses the original data files
from the games. Nuvie currently runs on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows. It should
be able to run on any platform that is supported by the SDL library.

We are currently focusing on Ultima 6 we hope to fully support Martian Dreams
and Savage Empire at a later date.

Compiling Nuvie
---------------

Nuvie requires LibSDL to compile. http://www.libsdl.org/

Unix (various)

Compiling should (hopefully) be as simple as

./configure
make

Win32

Nuvie can be compiled for win32 using MinGW


Using Nuvie
-----------

Config
------

Nuvie can be configured by editing the configuration file.

The config file will be automatically created the first time you launch
Nuvie on Windows and Mac OS X environments.

On Windows Vista/7/8 the config file (nuvie.cfg) is located at
\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Nuvie\

On Windows 2000/XP the config file (nuvie.cfg) is located at
\Documents and Settings\username\Application Data\Nuvie\

On Windows NT4 the config file (nuvie.cfg) is located at
<windir>\Profiles\username\Application Data\Nuvie\

On Windows 95/98/ME the config file (nuvie.cfg) lives alongside
the nuvie.exe file.

On Mac OS X the configuration file is called "Nuvie Preferences" and lives in
the following directory.
"~/Library/Preferences/Nuvie Preferences"

Linux users will need to manually create a config file in either "./nuvie.cfg"
or "~/.nuvierc"

A sample config file has been included nuvie.cfg.sample
